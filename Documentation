AutoGarden
**********
The purpose of this program is to run a fully autonomous and hands off irrigation
system. The user can change setting and customize the amount of days per week to
the watering is done, schedule times for watering, duration of watering session
and more.

Layout
======
The file PiGardenFunctions.py contains all the methods and variables which control
the system contained in a single class called PiGardenFunctions. AutomaticGarden.py
basically creates a menu for the user to interact with the system. Settings saved
to the Settings.txt file

Variables
=========
*wetthreshold- value of the under which the soil is considered moist. Note the
lower the valus is the more moist the soil is
*valvepin- pin in which the pi will be connected to the relay board
*waterduration- amount of time in seconds that the valve will stay open for each
aplication of water
*watertimes-list which stores the scheduled times to water the plants. Each time
is stores in a tuple of length 2 where index 0 is the hour and index 1 is the minute
*daysperweek- amount of times per week the plants will be watered
*waterdays- list of length 7 which corresponds to each day of the week. Each day
a boolean which corresponds to whether the plants should be watered on that day.
Note that Monday is index 0 and Sunday is index 6

Methods
=========
*openvalve- turns signal on relay high to open valve
*closevalve- turns signal on relay low to close valve
*getmoisture- pulls moisture values from the moisture sensor. Uses the mcp3008
library to pull values from the moisture sensor. Sensor must be connected to pin
5 of the mcp3008 chip
