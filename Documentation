AutoGarden
**********
The purpose of this program is to run a fully autonomous and hands off irrigation
system. The user can change setting in the setting file and use a corn job to make
it come on when needed.

Layout
======
The file PiGardenFunctions.py contains all the methods and variables which control
the system contained in a single class called PiGardenFunctions. AutomaticGarden.py
is the file which starts the garden and does the actual watering. Settings are saved
to the Settings.txt file

NOTE
=====
Throughout the class one will note that there are variables and functions related
to Scheduling. At first the program was being written with the idea of making it
keep track of scheduling itself, with the user interacting with the program
through a menu and not have to deal with cron jobs. It was decided that for the
first version we do not need to make it that user friendly so these functions and
variables are not being used. They are present if anyone wants to use them in the
future. Note they have not been debugged.

Variables
=========
*wetthreshold- value of the under which the soil is considered moist. Note the
lower the value is the more moist the soil is

*valvepin- pin in which the pi will be connected to the relay board

*waterduration- amount of time in seconds that the valve will stay open for each
application of water

*watertimes- list which stores scheduled times to water. Each element is a tuple
of length 2 where index 0 is the hours and 1 is the minutes. Note it should be in
24 hour times

*daysperweek= how many days per week the plants should be watered. The program
would later spread out the water days as evenly as possible

*waterdays = list of length 7 which corresponds to whether you should water on a
certain day or not. each element is a 1 or 0 for true or false.

Methods
=========
*openvalve- turns signal on relay high to open valve

*closevalve- turns signal on relay low to close valve

*getmoisture- pulls moisture values from the moisture sensor. Uses the mcp3008
library to pull values from the moisture sensor. Sensor must be connected to pin
5 of the mcp3008 chip. Return the values

*iswet - checks to see if the moisture readings meet the threshold and is wet.
returns boolean

*water - actually waters the garden. Checks that the soil is wet and the waters
the garden until it is. Will not water more than 8 times if the soil is still not
wet (in case something is wrong with the sensor). Returns True if soil has been
watered and false if it was already moist.

*updatefromfile- pulls settings from the Settings.txt file. The format for storage
is that values are writen after the colon for each specific setting. Settings that
are lists should have the elements seperated by spaces. Watering times should have
times written as the normally are (for example 8:00 or 17:34).

*defaultsettings- reverts all settings in the file to the default:
  1.waterduration = 5 seconds
  2.watertimes are 6:30am and 7:30pm
  3.daysperweek = 7
  4.waterdays = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1] (water every day)

Note: all the functions bellow are for scheduling

*calculatewaterdays- returns a list of 1s and 0s of length 7 describing which
days of the week to water. 1 means to water and 0 means to not. Calculates based
on the class variable daysperweek

*daytowater- return true or false depending on if the current day is a day to waters

*automated- function that is meant to run all the time. Will water the garden at
the scheduled time on a day to waters

*start - function which starts a thread for the automated function.

*changewaterduration- changes waterduration variable in settings and current instance of
the class. Takes and integer as an input

*changewatertimes- changes times which waterings are schduled to happen. takes a
list of tuples corresponding to times as input ( [(6,30),(21,50)] for example)

*changedaysperweek- changes daysperweek variable in settings and current instance of
the class. Takes and integer as an input

*changewaterdays - changes waterdays variable in settings and current instance of
the class. Takes a list of length 7 where each element is a 0 or 1 ([0,1,1,0,1,1,0] for example)
