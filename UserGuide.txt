Steps For Physical Setup
========================
1.Place the hardware of the system in a safe place where it cannot be wet or
tampered with near the garden.
2.Place the solar panels in a spot in which they seem most likely to get adequate
sun.
3.Connect a solenoid valve of the system to the water source of the garden. Keep
in mind that the size of the valve is 1/2" so you may need to make a converter pipe
of some kind.
4.Connect a soaker hose to the other end of the valve. bury the hose under the
ground very near to the roots of the plants in the garden.
5.Take the moisture sensor and insert it into the dirt closest to the roots of
the plant.
